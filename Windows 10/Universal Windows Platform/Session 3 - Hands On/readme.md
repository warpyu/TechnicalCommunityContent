# Enhancing Universal Windows Platform (UWP) Apps with Cortana #

---

<a name="Overview"></a>
## Overview ##

In a [famous scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hShY6xZWVGE) from the movie [Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092007/), chief engineer Scotty attempts to talk to a vintage PC. When the computer fails to respond, Scotty is handed a mouse â€” whereupon he holds the mouse like a microphone and says "Hello, computer."

Voice input and output, once considered a novelty in computer applications, are becoming more commonplace every day. That is the driving principle behind voice and speech APIs in the Universal Windows Platform (UWP), which, combined with [Microsoft Cortana](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/mobile/experiences/cortana/), provides a robust, extensible framework for building apps that react to voice commands and respond in kind with vocalizations of their own. Incorporating voice and speech in your apps is good not only for usability, but for accessibility as well.

In this lab, you will use Visual Studio 2017 to create a UWP app named Factoid that integrates with Cortana to present users with random, interesting facts, and that incorporates voice commands and speech synthesis to interact with users as naturally as they interact with each other.

## Exercise 1: Create a Universal Windows Platform app ##

Creating a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app is quick and easy using the built-in templates that ship with Visual Studio 2017. In this exercise, you will use Visual Studio 2017 to create a UWP app with custom branding to serve as a platform for subsequent exercises.

1. Start the Visual Studio installer. (An easy way to do that is to press the Windows key, type "installer," and select **Visual Studio Installer** from the menu.) Click the **Modify** button to view a list of installed components. Under "Workloads," make sure **Universal Windows Platform development** and **.NET desktop development** are checked. If they are not, check them and allow the installer to add these workloads.

    ![Installing the UWP and .NET development workloads](Images/required-workloads.png)

    _Installing the UWP and .NET development workloads_

1. Close the installer. Then start Visual Studio 2017 use the **File** -> **New** -> **Project** command to create a new Visual C# **Blank App (Universal Windows)** solution named "Factoid."

    ![Creating a new UWP solution](Images/vs-select-blank-template.png)

    _Creating a new UWP solution_

1. When prompted to choose target and minimum platform requirements, accept the defaults and click **OK**.

    ![Specifying the platform versions](Images/vs-target-platform.png)

    _Specifying the platform versions_

1. Go to Solution Explorer and review the files and folders created for the solution, taking special notice of the "Assets" folder and the **Package.appxmanifest** file. 

	![The new UWP solution](Images/vs-new-project-items.png)

	_The new UWP solution_
	
1. Next, you will add custom images to the project and update **Package.appxmanifest** to references those images and apply custom branding. In Solution Explorer, right-click the project's "Assets" folder and select **Add** -> **Existing Item...**.

    ![Adding items to the "Assets" folder](Images/vs-add-existing-item.png)

    _Adding items to the "Assets" folder_

1. In the "Add Existing Item" dialog, browse to the "Assets" folder in the "Resources" folder that accompanies this lab. Select all of the files in the "Assets" folder and click **Add**.

    ![Adding images to the "Assets" folder](Images/fe-select-all-assets.png)

    _Adding images to the "Assets" folder_

1. In Solution Explorer, double-click **Package.appxmanifest** to open it for editing. This file, known as the "app manifest," contains information about the app regarding images, display names, permissions, and capabilities.

1. Select the **Visual Assets** tab and ensure that **All Visual Assets** is selected on the left. These settings control the images, icons, and background colors used for the app's icons, logos, and splash screen.

    ![Viewing visual assets](Images/vs-ensure-visual-assets.png)

    _Viewing visual assets_

1. Scroll down to "Display Settings" and enter the hexadecimal color value #298FCC for both **Tile background** and **Splash screen background**.

    ![Updating the tile and splash-screen background colors](Images/vs-display-settings.png)

    _Updating the tile and splash-screen background colors_

1. Scroll down to "Preview Images." Type "Assets\SmallLogo.png" into the **Small Tile** box. Confirm that a thumbnail image appears below.
 
    ![Updating the small-tile image](Images/vs-update-small-logo.png)

    _Updating the small-tile image_

	> You can optionally provide small-tile images of various resolutions to make tiles created for your app look great on different devices. The Universal Windows Platform is smart enough to determine which image to display based on the screen resolution. If you provide only one image, Windows automatically scales it up and down as needed.

1. Scroll down to **Medium Tile** and enter "Assets\MediumLogo.png" into the box.
 
    ![Updating the medium-tile image](Images/vs-update-medium-logo.png)

    _Updating the medium-tile image_

1. Scroll down to **Wide Tile** and enter "Assets\WideLogo.png" into the box.
 
    ![Updating the wide-tile image](Images/vs-update-wide-logo.png)

    _Updating the wide-tile image_

1. Repeat the previous steps to enter the following values for the following assets:

	- For **Large Tile**, enter "Assets\LargeLogo.png"
	- For **App Icon**, enter "Assets\AppIcon.png"
	- For **Splash Screen**, enter "Assets\SplashLogo.png"
	- For **PackageLogo**, enter "Assets\PackageLogo.png"
 
    ![Updating the package logo](Images/vs-update-package-logo.png)

    _Updating the package logo_

1. Next, you will import a NuGet package that simplifies the handling of JSON data. In Solution Explorer, right-click **References** and select **Manage NuGet Packages...** from the context menu.

    ![Managing NuGet packages](Images/vs-manage-nuget-02.png)

    _Managing NuGet packages_

1. Make sure **Browse** is selected in the NuGet Package Manager. Then select the **Newtonsoft.Json** package and click **Install** to install the latest stable version. If prompted to review changes, click **OK**.

    ![Installing JSON.NET](Images/vs-install-json-net.png)

    _Installing JSON.NET_

Key elements of the app are now in place, including images for custom branding and a library to simplify dealing with JSON data. The next step is to write some code. 

<a name="Exercise2"></a>
## Exercise 2: Add common logic, models, and UI controls ##

In most apps, but especially in a UWP app, it's helpful to write code that is centralized and shared by other parts of the app. As a best practice, the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is recommended for UWP apps. Implementing MVVM means creating pages ("views") to provide the visual experience, models to define the structure of data, and one or more view-models to connect views to models and manage the user experience. In this exercise, you will add a model and a view-model to the app. You will also begin crafting a user experience by adding controls to the app's UI.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Factoid (Windows Universal)** project and use the **Add** -> **New Folder** command to add a folder named "Common" to the project.

1. Repeat this process to add folders named "Helpers," "Models," and "ViewModels" to the project.

1. Right-click the "Common" folder and select **Add** -> **Existing Item...**. Browse to the "Resources\Common" folder included with this lab, select all of the files in that folder, and click **Add** to import the files into the project's "Common" folder. 
 
    ![Importing files into the "Common" folder](Images/fe-select-all-common.png)

    _Importing files into the "Common" folder_

1. Right-click the "Helpers" folder and use the **Add** -> **Class** command to add a class file named **FactHelper.cs** to the folder.
 
    ![Adding the FactHelper class](Images/vs-add-fact-helper.png)

    _Adding the FactHelper class_

1. Replace the contents of the file with the following code:

	```C#
	using Newtonsoft.Json;
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Net.Http;
	using System.Runtime.Serialization.Json;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	
	namespace Factoid.Helpers
	{
	    public static class FactHelper
	    {
	        public async static Task<string> GetFactAsync()
	        {
	            string fact = null;
	
	            using (HttpClient client = new HttpClient())
	            {
	                var response = await client.GetStringAsync(new Uri("https://traininglabservices.azurewebsites.net/api/Facts/1"));
	                fact = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<string>(response);
	            }
	
	            return fact;
	        }
	    }
	}
	```

	The ```GetFactAsync``` method calls an external Azure App Service to retrieve a random fact for the app to display.

1. Right-click the "Models" folder and use the **Add** -> **Class** command to add a class file named **FactInformation.cs**. Then replace the contents of the file with the following code:

	```C#
	using Factoid.Common;
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	using System.Windows.Input;
	
	namespace Factoid.Models
	{
	    public class FactInformation : Common.ObservableBase
	    {
	        private Guid _id;
	        public Guid Id
	        {
	            get { return this._id; }
	            set { this.SetProperty(ref this._id, value); }
	        }
	
	        private string _label;
	        public string Label
	        {
	            get { return this._label; }
	            set { this.SetProperty(ref this._label, value); }
	        }
	
	        private bool _isFavorite;
	        public bool IsFavorite
	        {
	            get { return this._isFavorite; }
	            set { this.SetProperty(ref this._isFavorite, value); }
	        }
	    }
	}
	```

1. Right-click the "ViewModels" folder and use the **Add** -> **Class** command to add a class file named **MainViewModel.cs**. Then replace the contents of the file with the following code:

	```C#
	using Factoid.Models;
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Collections.ObjectModel;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	
	namespace Factoid.ViewModels
	{
	    public class MainViewModel : Common.ObservableBase
	    {
	        public MainViewModel()
	        {
	            this.AllFacts = new ObservableCollection<FactInformation>();
	        }
	
	        private ObservableCollection<FactInformation> _allFacts;
	        public ObservableCollection<FactInformation> AllFacts
	        {
	            get { return this._allFacts; }
	            set { this.SetProperty(ref this._allFacts, value); }
	        }
	
	        private FactInformation _currentFact;
	        public FactInformation CurrentFact
	        {
	            get { return this._currentFact; }
	            set { this.SetProperty(ref this._currentFact, value); }
	        }
	
	        public async void LoadFactsAsync()
	        {
	            for (int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)
	            {
	                var fact = await Helpers.FactHelper.GetFactAsync();
	                this.AllFacts.Add(new FactInformation() { Id = Guid.NewGuid(), IsFavorite = false, Label = fact });
	            }
	        }
	
	        public async void LoadFactAsync()
	        {
	            var fact = await Helpers.FactHelper.GetFactAsync();
	            this.CurrentFact = new FactInformation() { Id = Guid.NewGuid(), IsFavorite = false, Label = fact };
	        }
	    }
	}
	```

1. In Solution Explorer, open **App.xaml** and locate the closing ```</Application>``` tag

    ![Locating the closing Application tag](Images/vs-app-xaml-closing-app.png)

    _Locating the closing Application tag_

1. Add the following statements directly above the closing tag:
 
	```XAML
	<Application.Resources>
        <ResourceDictionary>
            <Color x:Key="AppMainAccentColor">#FF298FCC</Color>
            <local:HasContextToEnabledConverter x:Key="HasContextToEnabledConverter" />
            <local:IsFavoriteBackgroundConverter x:Key="IsFavoriteBackgroundConverter" />
            <local:IsFavoriteThemeConverter x:Key="IsFavoriteThemeConverter" />
            <local:FavoriteSymbolConverter x:Key="FavoriteSymbolConverter" />
            <local:FavoriteLabelConverter x:Key="FavoriteLabelConverter" />
        </ResourceDictionary>
    </Application.Resources>
	```

1. Open **App.xaml.cs** and add the following line of code to the ```App``` class:

	```C#
	public static ViewModels.MainViewModel ViewModel = new ViewModels.MainViewModel();
	```

    ![Modifying the App class](Images/vs-add-static-view-model.png)

    _Modifying the App class_

1. The Factoid app now contains a model describing the "data" used by the app â€” in this case, random, interesting facts â€” and a view-model to drive the user experience. Now it is time to add controls to the main page of the app in order to display those facts. Begin by opening **MainPage.xaml** and replacing the current contents of the file with the following XAML:

	```XAML
	<Page
    x:Class="Factoid.MainPage"
    xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
    xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
    xmlns:local="using:Factoid"
    xmlns:d="http://schemas.microsoft.com/expression/blend/2008"
    xmlns:mc="http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006"
    mc:Ignorable="d">
 
    <Grid Background="{ThemeResource ApplicationPageBackgroundThemeBrush}">

        <Grid.RowDefinitions>
            <RowDefinition Height="Auto" />
            <RowDefinition/>
        </Grid.RowDefinitions>

        <StackPanel x:Name="headerPanel">
            <TextBlock x:Name="titleLabel" Text="Welcome to Factoid" TextWrapping="Wrap"/>
            <TextBlock x:Name="subtitleLabel" FontWeight="Light" TextWrapping="Wrap">
                <Run Text="Here are a few interesting facts just for you."/>
                <LineBreak/>
                <Run Text="Select a fact and tap 'Hear' to have the fact read aloud."/>
            </TextBlock>
        </StackPanel>

        <GridView x:Name="mainGridView" SelectionMode="Single" SelectedItem="{Binding CurrentFact, Mode=TwoWay}" Grid.Row="1" ItemsSource="{Binding AllFacts}">
            <GridView.ItemTemplate>
                <DataTemplate>
                    <Border RequestedTheme="{Binding IsFavorite, Converter={StaticResource IsFavoriteThemeConverter}}" Background="{Binding IsFavorite, Converter={StaticResource IsFavoriteBackgroundConverter}}" Width="260" Height="200" Margin="5" BorderBrush="DarkGray" BorderThickness="1">
                        <Grid ToolTipService.ToolTip="{Binding Label}">
                            <TextBlock TextTrimming="CharacterEllipsis" Style="{ThemeResource SubtitleTextBlockStyle}" FontWeight="Light" HorizontalAlignment="Center" VerticalAlignment="Center" TextAlignment="Center" TextWrapping="Wrap" Margin="20" Text="{Binding Label}"></TextBlock>
                        </Grid>
                    </Border>
                </DataTemplate>
            </GridView.ItemTemplate>
        </GridView>

        <VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>
            <VisualStateGroup>
                <VisualState x:Name="WideLayout">
                    <VisualState.StateTriggers>
                        <AdaptiveTrigger MinWindowWidth="900" />
                    </VisualState.StateTriggers>
                    <VisualState.Setters>
                        <Setter Target="headerPanel.Margin" Value="40,40,40,0" />
                        <Setter Target="mainGridView.Margin" Value="40,10,40,40" />
                        <Setter Target="mainGridView.HorizontalAlignment" Value="Stretch" />
                        <Setter Target="titleLabel.Style" Value="{ThemeResource TitleTextBlockStyle}" />
                        <Setter Target="subtitleLabel.Style" Value="{ThemeResource SubtitleTextBlockStyle}" />
                    </VisualState.Setters>
                </VisualState>

                <VisualState x:Name="NarrowLayout">
                    <VisualState.StateTriggers>
                        <AdaptiveTrigger MinWindowWidth="0" />
                    </VisualState.StateTriggers>
                    <VisualState.Setters>
                        <Setter Target="headerPanel.Margin" Value="20,20,20,0" />
                        <Setter Target="mainGridView.Margin" Value="20" />
                        <Setter Target="mainGridView.HorizontalAlignment" Value="Center" />
                        <Setter Target="titleLabel.Style" Value="{ThemeResource SubtitleTextBlockStyle}" />
                        <Setter Target="subtitleLabel.Style" Value="{ThemeResource BodyTextBlockStyle}" />
                    </VisualState.Setters>
                </VisualState>
            </VisualStateGroup>
        </VisualStateManager.VisualStateGroups>

    </Grid>
	</Page>	
	```

	The main page uses UWP's ```GridView``` control to display random facts. And it uses visual states and adaptive triggers to implement a user experience that adapts to various device orientations and screen solutions. 

1. Open **MainPage.xaml.cs**. Locate the ```MainPage``` class constructor and replace it with the following code:

	```C#
	public MainPage()
    {
        this.InitializeComponent();
        this.Loaded += MainPage_Loaded;
    }

    private void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
    {
        App.ViewModel.LoadFactsAsync();
        this.DataContext = App.ViewModel;
    }
	```
	Notice the line of code that sets the page's ```DataContext``` property equal to the static ```App.ViewModel``` property added earlier in this exercise. This is what connects the view to the view-model.

1. In order to build and run UWP apps on a Windows 10 PC, you must enable developer mode on the device. To ensure that developer mode is enabled, click the **Windows** button (also known as the Start button) in the lower-left corner of the desktop. Then select **Settings** from the menu and click **Update & security** in the Settings dialog. Now click **For developers** on the left and select **Developer mode** on the right, as shown below.

    ![Enabling developer mode in Windows 10](Images/enable-developer-mode.png)

    _Enabling developer mode in Windows 10_

1. Use Visual Studio's **Debug** -> **Start Without Debugging** command (or press **CTRL+F5**) to launch the app.

    ![Factoid displaying random, interesting facts](Images/app-first-run.png)

    _Factoid displaying random, interesting facts_

1. Make the Factoid window narrower and notice how the UI adapts.

    ![Adaptive layout in action](Images/app-first-run-thin.png)

    _Adaptive layout in action_

It's a good start, but right now, the app is as deaf and dumb as the computer that Scotty spoke to in "The Voyage Home." Let's fix that by adding a dose of Cortana.

<a name="Exercise3"></a>
## Exercise 3: Integrate Cortana voice commands ##

In this exercise, you will modify Factoid to make Cortana aware of it. Afterwards, you will be able to launch Factoid by asking Cortana to tell you an interesting fact. Later, you will take this integration a step further and allow Cortana to tell you interesting facts without displaying Factoid.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Factoid (Universal Windows)** project and use the **Add** -> **New Item...** command to add an XML file named **FactoidVoiceCommands.xml** to the project.

    ![Adding an XML file](Images/vs-select-data-xml.png)

    _Adding an XML file_

1. Add the following XML to the file directly after the opening ```xml``` element:

	```XML
	<VoiceCommands xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/voicecommands/1.2">
	  <CommandSet xml:lang="en-US" Name="FactoidCommandSet_en-us">
	    <AppName>Factoid</AppName>
	    <Example>Tell me an interesting fact</Example>
		    
	    
	  </CommandSet>
	</VoiceCommands>
	```

	Observe the ```xml:lang="en-US"``` attribute on the ```CommandSet``` element. This attribute defines the command set for devices whose language is set for English (U.S.) and although optional, it is considered a best practice to define command sets on a per-language basis.

    ![Defining an English command set](Images/vs-vc-lang.png)

    _Defining an English command set_

1. Add the following command definition after the ```Example``` element:

	```XML
	<Command Name="TellMeFactCommand">
      <Example>Tell me an interesting fact</Example>
      <ListenFor>Tell me [a] [an] [interesting] fact</ListenFor>
      <Feedback>Finding you an interesting fact</Feedback>
      <Navigate />
    </Command>
	```
1. Observe the plain language used in the ```ListenFor``` element, complete with words surrounded by square brackets indicating that these words are optional.

    ![The updated voice-command file](Images/vs-update-vc-file-02.png)

    _The updated voice-command file_

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the "Helpers" folder and use the **Add** -> **Class** command to add a class file named **SpeechHelper.cs** to the folder. Change the scope of the ```SpeechHelper``` class by adding the keywords ```public static``` to the class definition:

    ![Changing the class scope](Images/vs-add-public-static.png)

    _Changing the class scope_

1. Add the following ```using``` statements to the top of the file:

	```C#
	using Windows.ApplicationModel.VoiceCommands;
	using Windows.Storage;
	```

1. Add the following method to the ```SpeechHelper``` class to load the voice-command file and pass it to Cortana:

	```C#
	public async static Task InitializeVoiceCommandsAsync(bool updatePhraseLists = true)
    {
        try
        {
            StorageFile commandsFile = await Windows.ApplicationModel.Package.Current.InstalledLocation.GetFileAsync(@"FactoidVoiceCommands.xml");
            await VoiceCommandDefinitionManager.InstallCommandDefinitionsFromStorageFileAsync(commandsFile);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
        }

        return;
    }	
	```

1. Open **App.xaml.cs** and add the following statement to the ```OnLaunched``` method, making it first statement in that method:

	```C#
	await Helpers.SpeechHelper.InitializeVoiceCommandsAsync();
	```

1. Mark the ```OnLaunched``` method as asynchronous by adding the keyword ```async```:

    ![Adding the async keyword](Images/vs-updated-on-launched.png)

    _Adding the async keyword_

1. Use Visual Studio's **Debug** -> **Start Without Debugging** command (or press **CTRL+F5**) to launch the app.

1. Find Cortana in your PC's task bar (look in the lower-left corner of the desktop) and type "Factoid tell me an interesting fact." Then press **Enter**.

    ![Typing a Cortana command](Images/ask-cortana.png)

    _Typing a Cortana command_

1. Confirm that Cortana brings Factoid, which is already running, to the foreground.

    ![Factoid activated after a hand-off from Cortana](Images/app-show-facts.png)

    _Factoid activated after a hand-off from Cortana_

1. If there is a microphone attached to your PC, click the **microphone icon** next to "Ask me anything" in Cortana and **speak** the command "Factoid tell me an interesting fact." Confirm that Cortana once more activates the Factoid app.

1. Close Factoid and return to Visual Studio.

So now Cortana understands the command "Factoid tell me an interesting fact" as a command to launch or activate Factoid. That's mildly interesting, but it's only the first step in building a bridge between Cortana and Factoid to allow it do things that are even more interesting.

## Exercise 4: Add speech synthesis ##

The Universal Windows Platform makes it easy to add speech synthesis to your apps. It's a great way to make apps more accessible to users with impaired vision, or to simply provide the convenience of having content read aloud. In this exercise, you will enhance Factoid to read facts to you.

1. Open **SpeechHelper.cs** in the project's "Helpers" folder. Add the following ```using``` statements to the top of the file:

	```C#
	using Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls;
	using Windows.Media.SpeechSynthesis;
	```

1. Now add the following method, which uses UWP's ```SpeechSynthesize``` class to synthesize speech from text, to the ```SpeechHelper``` class:

	```C#
	public async static Task ReadFactAsync(string fact)
	{
	    var synthesizer = new SpeechSynthesizer();
	    synthesizer.Voice = SpeechSynthesizer.AllVoices.Where(w => w.Gender == VoiceGender.Female && w.Language.Equals(System.Globalization.CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name)).FirstOrDefault();
	    SpeechSynthesisStream stream = await synthesizer.SynthesizeTextToStreamAsync(fact);
	
	    var mediaElement = new MediaElement();
	    mediaElement.SetSource(stream, stream.ContentType);
	    mediaElement.Play();
	
	    return;
	}
	```

1. Open **FactInformation.cs** in the project's "Models" folder. Add the following property definition after the other properties defined in the ```FactInformation``` class:

	```C#
	public ICommand ReadCommand
	{
	    get
	    {
	        return new RelayCommand(async () =>
	        {
	            await Helpers.SpeechHelper.ReadFactAsync(this.Label);
	        });
	    }
	}
	```


1. Open **MainPage.xaml** and insert the following code directly above the opening ```<Grid>``` tag to create a ```CommandBar``` with an ```AppBarButton``` that is connected to the ```ReadCommand``` property you added in the previous step:

	```XAML
	<Page.BottomAppBar>
        <CommandBar RequestedTheme="Dark" Background="#FF298FCC">
            <AppBarButton IsEnabled="{Binding CurrentFact, Converter={StaticResource HasContextToEnabledConverter}}" Icon="Microphone" Label="Hear" Command="{Binding CurrentFact.ReadCommand}"/>
        </CommandBar>
    </Page.BottomAppBar>
	```

1. Use Visual Studio's **Debug** -> **Start Without Debugging** command (or press **CTRL+F5**) to launch Factoid. Click one of the facts to select it, and then click the **microphone icon** in the app bar. Confirm that the fact you selected is read aloud.

    ![Reading a fact aloud](Images/app-click-hear.png)

    _Reading a fact aloud_

1. Close Factoid and return to Visual Studio.

There is more than you can do with the ```SpeechSynthesizer``` class, including selecting different voices and languages. For more information, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.media.speechsynthesis.speechsynthesizer.

<a name="Exercise5"></a>
## Exercise 5: Create a UWP Service ##
Cortana has powerful speech-recognition capabilities, and your app now incorporates speech synthesis, but how do you tie these together to create a seamless experience, particularly when your app isnâ€™t active? The answer is a UWP app service. An app service is a type of background service that functions somewhat like an old-fashioned Windows service, but that is directly connected to your app. In this exercise, you will add an app service to the solution and update the voice command definition to allow Cortana to display facts retrieved from Factoid without launching the app.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Factoid** solution (not the project) and use the **Add** -> **New Project...** command to add a **Windows Runtime Component (Windows Universal)** project named "Factoid.Services.Background" to the solution. When prompted to choose target and minimum platform requirements, accept the defaults and click **OK**.

    ![Adding a new project to the solution](Images/vs-create-new-rtc.png)

    _Adding a new project to the solution_

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Class1.cs** file in the new project and use the **Rename** command to rename the file "GeneralCommandService.cs." When asked if you want to rename all project references, click **Yes**.

1. Replace the contents of **GeneralCommandService.cs** with the following code:

	```C#
	using System;
	using System.Collections.Generic;
	using System.Linq;
	using System.Text;
	using System.Threading.Tasks;
	using Windows.ApplicationModel.AppService;
	using Windows.ApplicationModel.Background;
	using Windows.ApplicationModel.VoiceCommands;
	using Windows.Media.SpeechRecognition;
	
	namespace Factoid.Services.Background
	{
	    public sealed class GeneralCommandService : IBackgroundTask
	    {
	        VoiceCommandServiceConnection voiceServiceConnection;
	        BackgroundTaskDeferral serviceDeferral;
	
	        public async void Run(IBackgroundTaskInstance taskInstance)
	        {
	            serviceDeferral = taskInstance.GetDeferral();
	            taskInstance.Canceled += OnTaskCanceled;
	
	            var triggerDetails = taskInstance.TriggerDetails as AppServiceTriggerDetails;
	
	            try
	            {
	                voiceServiceConnection = VoiceCommandServiceConnection.FromAppServiceTriggerDetails(triggerDetails);
	                voiceServiceConnection.VoiceCommandCompleted += OnVoiceCommandCompleted;
	                VoiceCommand voiceCommand = await voiceServiceConnection.GetVoiceCommandAsync();
	                var interpretation = voiceCommand.SpeechRecognitionResult.SemanticInterpretation;
	                await ProcessGenerateFactAsync(interpretation);
	                this.serviceDeferral.Complete();
	            }
	            catch (Exception ex)
	            {
	            }
	        }
	
	        private async Task ProcessGenerateFactAsync(SpeechRecognitionSemanticInterpretation interpretation)
	        {
	            await Helpers.ProgressHelper.ShowProgressScreenAsync(voiceServiceConnection, "Okay, get ready...");
	            string fact = await Helpers.FactHelper.GetFactAsync();
	            var destinationsContentTiles = new List<VoiceCommandContentTile>();
	            var destinationTile = new VoiceCommandContentTile();
	
	            try
	            {
	                destinationTile.ContentTileType = VoiceCommandContentTileType.TitleWithText;
	                destinationTile.AppContext = null;
	                destinationTile.AppLaunchArgument = "fact=" + fact;
	                destinationTile.Title = fact;
	                destinationTile.TextLine1 = "";
	                destinationTile.TextLine1 = "(tap to add to favorites)";
	
	                destinationsContentTiles.Add(destinationTile);
	            }
	            catch (Exception ex)
	            {
	            }
	
	            VoiceCommandResponse response = VoiceCommandResponse.CreateResponse(new VoiceCommandUserMessage()
	            {
	                DisplayMessage = "Did you know...",
	                SpokenMessage = fact
	
	            }, destinationsContentTiles);
	
	            await voiceServiceConnection.ReportSuccessAsync(response);
	        }
	
	        private void OnVoiceCommandCompleted(VoiceCommandServiceConnection sender, VoiceCommandCompletedEventArgs args)
	        {
	            if (this.serviceDeferral != null)
	            {
	                this.serviceDeferral.Complete();
	            }
	        }
	
	        private void OnTaskCanceled(IBackgroundTaskInstance sender, BackgroundTaskCancellationReason reason)
	        {
	            if (this.serviceDeferral != null)
	            {
	                this.serviceDeferral.Complete();
	            }
	        }
	    }
	}
	```

1. Right-click the **Factoid.Services.Background (Windows Universal)** project and use the **Add** -> **New Folder** command to add a folder named "Helpers" to the project.

1. Right-click the "Helpers" folder and select **Add** -> **Existing Item...**. Browse to the "Resources\Helpers" folder included with this lab, select all of the files in that folder, and click **Add** to import the files into the project's "Helpers" folder. 

    ![Importing files into the "Helpers" folder](Images/fe-add-helpers.png)

    _Importing files into the "Helpers" folder_

1. Right-click the **Factoid.Services.Background (Universal Windows)** project and select **Manage NuGet Packages...**. Make sure **Browse** is selected in the NuGet Package Manager. Then select the **Newtonsoft.Json** package and click **Install** to install the latest stable version. If prompted to review changes, click **OK**.

    ![Installing JSON.NET](Images/vs-install-json-net.png)

    _Installing JSON.NET_

1. Right-click **References** in the **Factoid (Universal Windows)** project, and select **Add Reference**.

1. Click **Solution** under **Projects** to list the other projects in the solution, and check the box next to **Factoid.Services.Background**. Then click **OK** to add a reference to that project.

    ![Adding a reference to Factoid.Services.Background](Images/vs-add-reference.png)

    _Adding a reference to Factoid.Services.Background_

1. Open **Package.appxmanifest** in the **Factoid (Universal Windows)** project and select the **Declarations** tab.

    ![Opening the manifest](Images/vs-package-declarations.png)

    _Opening the manifest_

1. Select **App Service** from the **Available Declarations** list and click **Add**. Type "GeneralCommandService" into the **Name** box and "Factoid.Services.Background.GeneralCommandService" into the **Entry point** box. Then press **Ctrl+S** to save your changes.

    ![Adding an App Service declaration](Images/vs-add-app-service.png)

    _Adding an App Service declaration_

1. Open **FactoidVoiceCommands.xml** and replace the empty ```Navigate``` element with the following element:

	```XML
	<VoiceCommandService Target="GeneralCommandService"/>
	```

    ![Replacing the Navigate element](Images/vs-updated-navigation-element.png)

    _Replacing the Navigate element_

	The new element instructs Cortana to invoke the voice-command service named "GeneralCommandService" when she recognizes input matching the ```ListenFor``` phrase.

1. Use Visual Studio's **Debug** -> **Start Without Debugging**  (or press **Ctrl+F5**) launch Factoid. Once Factoid is up and running, close it.

1. To make sure Cortana doesn't cache old commands, bring up the Windows Task Manager, select **Cortana** in the list of background tasks, and click the **End task** button to end the Cortana process. Then close Task Manager.

	> Stopping Cortana this way is not always necessary, but it is a good habit to get into while testing abd debugging to make sure Cortana is starting with a "clean slate" of commands.

    ![Ending the Cortana process](Images/kill-cortana.png)

    _Ending the Cortana process_

1. Go to Cortana in your PC's task bar and issue the command "Factoid tell me an interesting fact," either by typing it or voicing it.

	![Issuing a command to Cortana](Images/cortana-speak-command.png)

    _Issuing a command to Cortana_

1. Confirm that Cortana displays an interesting fact like the one below. Note that the fact came from Factoid, not from Cortana herself.

	![Cortana displaying a fact obtained from Factoid](Images/cortana-fact-result-01.png)

    _Cortana displaying a fact obtained from Factoid_

Now that Factoid is more tightly integrated with Cortana, the final step to incorporate Cortana "Personal Assistant" actions.

<a name="Exercise6"></a>
## Exercise 6: Add Personal Assistant actions ##

One of the lesser-known but more powerful aspects of Cortana is the notion of "Personal Assistant" actions. In general, this means Cortana can be given permission to send information to your app through an app service running in the background, and then activate the app itself after the app service has executed.  In this exercise, you will enhance Factoid so that facts presented in Cortana can be "favorited" by the user, and will then appear as favorites in Factoid itself and even appear on the app's tile.

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click **Package.appxmanifest** and select **View Code**. If prompted with a dialog stating that **Package.appxmanifest** is already open and asking if you want to close it, click **Yes**.

1. Locate the closing ```</Extensions>``` tag and add the following statement just above it:

	```XML
	<uap:Extension Category="windows.personalAssistantLaunch"/>
	```

	![Modifying Package.appxmanifest](Images/vs-add-launch.png)

    _Modifying Package.appxmanifest_

1. Right-click the "Helpers" folder in the **Factoid (Universal Windows)** project and use the **Add** -> **Existing Item...** command to import all of the files in the "Resources\\PersonalAssistant\Helpers" folder included with this lab. 

	![Importing files into the "Helpers" folder](Images/fe-select-all-pa-helpers.png)

    _Importing files into the "Helpers" folder_

1. Open **MainViewModel.cs** in the "ViewModels" folder and add the following statements to the beginning of the ```LoadFactsAsync``` method:
 
	> Be careful to add them to ```LoadFactsAsync``` (plural), not ```LoadFactAsync```, because the ```MainViewModel``` class contains both.

	```C#
	var favorites = await Helpers.StorageHelper.GetFavoritesAsync();
	
	foreach (var favorite in favorites)
	{
	    this.AllFacts.Add(favorite);
	}
	```

1. Open **FactInformation.cs** in the "Models" folder and add the following statements above the ```ReadCommand``` property. These new commands enable facts to be marked as favorites. They also enable facts to be displayed on the app's tile when the tile is pinned to the Windows start screen.

	```C#
	public ICommand ToggleFavoriteCommand
	{
	    get
	    {
	        return new RelayCommand(async () =>
	        {
	            this.IsFavorite = !this.IsFavorite;
	
	            if (this.IsFavorite)
	            {
	                await Helpers.StorageHelper.SaveFavoriteAsync(this);
	                Helpers.TileHelper.PinFact(App.ViewModel.CurrentFact.Label);
	            }
	            else
	            {
	                await Helpers.StorageHelper.RemoteFavoriteAsync(this);
	            }                    
	        });
	    }
	}

	public ICommand AddToFavoritesCommand
	{
	    get
	    {
	        return new RelayCommand(async () =>
	        {
	            if (App.ViewModel != null) App.ViewModel.AllFacts.Insert(0, this);
	            await Helpers.StorageHelper.SaveFavoriteAsync(this);
	            App.ViewModel.CurrentFact = this;
	            Helpers.TileHelper.PinFact(App.ViewModel.CurrentFact.Label);	
	        });
	    }
	}
	``` 

1. Open **MainPage.xaml** and insert the following statement just before the existing ```AppBarButton``` declaration near the top of the file:

	```XAML
	<AppBarButton IsEnabled="{Binding CurrentFact, Converter={StaticResource HasContextToEnabledConverter}}" Icon="{Binding CurrentFact.IsFavorite, Converter={StaticResource FavoriteSymbolConverter}}" Label="{Binding CurrentFact.IsFavorite, Converter={StaticResource FavoriteLabelConverter}}" Command="{Binding CurrentFact.ToggleFavoriteCommand}"/>
	```

1. Finally, open **App.xaml.cs** and insert the following methods after the ```App``` constructor:

	```C#
	protected async override void OnActivated(IActivatedEventArgs args)
	{
	    var activator = args as Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.ProtocolActivatedEventArgs;
		
	    if (activator != null)
	    {
	        var parameters = (args as Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.ProtocolActivatedEventArgs).Uri.Query;
	        string content = Uri.UnescapeDataString(parameters).Split('=').Last();
		
	        Models.FactInformation fact = new Models.FactInformation()
	        {
	            Id = Guid.NewGuid(),
	            IsFavorite = true,
	            Label = content,
	        };
		
	        fact.AddToFavoritesCommand.Execute(null);
	    }
		
	    await EnsurePageCreatedAndActivateAsync();
	}
		
	private async System.Threading.Tasks.Task EnsurePageCreatedAndActivateAsync()
	{   
	    await Helpers.SpeechHelper.InitializeVoiceCommandsAsync();
		
	    if (Window.Current.Content == null)
	    {
	        Window.Current.Content = new MainPage();
	    }
		
	    Window.Current.Activate();
	}
	```

	The first of these two methods overrides the ```OnActivated``` method so Factoid can respond to commands from Cortana.

1. Use Visual Studio's **Debug** -> **Start Without Debugging** command (or press **CTRL+F5**) to launch Factoid.

1. Go to Cortana in your PC's task bar and issue the command "Factoid tell me an interesting fact," either by typing it or voicing it.

	![Issuing a command to Cortana](Images/cortana-speak-command.png)

    _Issuing a command to Cortana_

1. Wait until a fact is displayed, and then click (or tap) it.

	![Adding a fact to favorites](Images/cortana-tap-to-add.png)

    _Adding a fact to favorites_

1. Confirm that the fact you favorited appears in Factoid.

	![Factoid displaying a fact favorited in Cortana](Images/app-after-favorite.png)

    _Factoid displaying a fact favorited in Cortana_

1. If you decide that you don't want the fact treated as a favorite any longer, simply tap the **Favorite** button that now appears in the app bar:

	![Unfavoriting a fact](Images/app-un-favorite.png)

    _Unfavoriting a fact_

1. Select a different fact in the app and tap the **Favorite** button to mark it as a favorite.

1. Pin Factoid to the start screen to create a tile for it. Find the tile and confirm that the facts you selected as favorites appear on the tile. (If you favorited more than one fact, the fact displayed on the tile will rotate from time to time.)

	![Factoid facts displaying on the Start Screen](Images/os-fact-tile.png)

    _Factoid facts displaying on the Start Screen_

Each time you start the app, it will display any favorites you have selected and fill in the remaining slots with randomly selected facts. Use the **Favorite** button to favorite and unfavorite facts as desired and control what appears on the app's tile.
