**Introduction**

The Internet of Things (IoT) universe is rapidly expanding. IoT devices continue to proliferate, and the opportunity for creating innovative solutions using internet-connected data collection devices together with advanced analytics has never been greater. For developers, however, IoT’s huge potential also presents significant challenges. You’re facing countless devices producing a massive variety of unstructured data that you need to manage, control, secure, and effectively utilize. How do you ensure you’re not swept up in an avalanche of newly created internet-connected devices and instead are able to deliver on the promise of IoT?

IoT complexity can make it difficult to figure out how to get started or take the next steps. Like the number of IoT devices themselves, the amount of technical information around IoT is skyrocketing, and determining what information you need and where to locate it presents its own challenges. To help you navigate the sometimes-daunting world of IoT, we’ve taken our key learnings and put them in one handy place. Get started on your IoT journey, and enjoy the ride!

**Getting started: What is IoT?**

Search on the “Internet of Things” and you’ll find a multitude of results. In short, IoT is an overarching term for applications where we gain intelligence from devices connected to a network. These devices can be thermostats, occupancy sensors, chemical sensors, etc.—anything that collects data and sends it to another device, to the cloud, or soon enough, maybe to your refrigerator! With 30 billion connected devices predicted to be in place worldwide by 2020, IoT is the umbrella to a huge and diverse collection of applications.

A comprehensive IoT cloud solution like Azure IoT Suite lets you integrate all your devices and systems to uncover data and insights that can transform your business. To speed your IoT development, we even include some preconfigured IoT solutions such as remote monitoring and predictive maintenance. See how [Microsoft Azure IoT is simplifies IoT further](https://blogs.microsoft.com/iot/2017/04/20/microsoft-simplifies-iot-further/), and check out our [IoT webpage](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-of-things/) to learn more.
