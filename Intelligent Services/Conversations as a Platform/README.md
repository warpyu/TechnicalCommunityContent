# Community Content - Conversations as a Platform #

## Session Content ##

Each sub-folder provides content for one session.  You may also see additional folders with materials that are shared between sessions.  The sessions will refer to those folders.

Each session presentation is intended to last around 45-minutes, allowing time for Q&A if desired.

The sessions should be delivered in order either one event at a time, or as a set during a single event.

Each session may include one or more of:
- a PowerPoint deck including notes
- demo instructions including for setup prior to the session and in-session delivery
- where applicable, hands-on-lab (HOL) instructions for attendees, which can be done under presenter supervision during a session, shown as another presentation by the presenter or taken away by attendees

You will also find below, links to presenter training videos, providing examples (where appropriate) of how to present session content. Note that the demo script files may content content and notes more recent than the video.
